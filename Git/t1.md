create a new branch
git branch newImage
The branch newImage now refers to the actual commit


Choose the branch for commiting 
git checkout newImage
(git switch)


Create a new branch and check it out at the same time
git checkout -b name


Merging branch into main* (staying on main branch) - creates new merge commit on main*
git merge bugFix


urrent branch - git merge branch that you want merge with

Placed on bugFix aand merge with main

git checkout bufFix; git merge main


For combining commits with linear sequence. With bugFix selected
git rebase main

Now bugFix copies of commits move at the top of main branch (rebased onto main), so history is linear

Checked out on the main and rebase onto bugFix
Move the main branch reference forward on history


HEAD points to the current branch on the recent (last) commit

Detaching HEAD - attaching it to a commit instead of a branch.

Was: 
HEAD -> main -> Commit1

Git checkout Commit1

Now:
HEAD -> Commit1

Changes are not effect of any branches


Relative refs
allow us use HEAD or branch name to moving on history

git checkout main^.  Find the parent of the specified commit. Now HEAD points on commits parent. This detach HEAD
Git cheackout commit2;
git checkout HEAD~3.   Num times moves HEAD to parents

-f option (not allowed for current branch) reasign a branch to a commit
git branch -f main HEAD~3
Moves by force the main branch to three parents behind HEAD


Rrvering changes

Revers changes by moving a branch reference backwars in time to an older commit.
git reset HEAD~1

Reverse last commit changes and share those with others - create commit with reversed changes:
git revert HEAD


git cherry-pick C1 C2 ...
Copy commits below HEAD (after - make them lasts)
