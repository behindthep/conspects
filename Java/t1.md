### Errors, Compiler

- Syntax errors are detected **during compilation**, before the program starts running.


- At the basic level, computers operate only with **numbers**.


- In Java, **integer division** is used **by default**: 3 / 2 = 1


### Variables

```java
var greeting = "Father";
greeting = "Mother"; // 'var' is not needed here because it was already declared.
```

- Java is **statically typed** language - the var type is set when it declared and cannot be changed afterwards.

If you try to assign a number to the same var, you will get an error: incompatible types: int cannot be converted to java.lang.String.

The **compiler** performs this check without running the code - this type of typing called static typing.
In dynamic languages, the same behavior would not cause an error - a var can change its type during execution.
